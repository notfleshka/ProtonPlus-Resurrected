# What even is this?
This is an attempt to resurrect ProtonPlus kernel for Samsung Galaxy A52 and A72.
## What is the point if there's original version?
It's dead, developer officially announced that he's discontinuing any support for it.
## Can I contribute?
Sure. You can open [pull requests](https://github.com/notfleshka/ProtonPlus-Resurrected/pulls) to merge your code(and most likely it will be merged, if it's useful and working) or report bugs on [Issues page](https://github.com/notfleshka/ProtonPlus-Resurrected/issues).
